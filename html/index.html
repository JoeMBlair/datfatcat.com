		<h2>The beginning</h2>
		<p>Cities fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. you measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you. boxing is about respect. getting it for yourself, and taking it away from the other guy. well, what is it today? more spelunking? boxing is about respect. getting it for yourself, and taking it away from the other guy. cities fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. that tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass. i did the same thing to gandhi, he didn't eat for three weeks. mister wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when i'm asked, i don't have to lie. but don't think of me as an idiot. rehabilitated? well, now let me see. you know, i don't have any idea what that means. well, what is it today? more spelunking? i once heard a wise man say there are no perfect men. only perfect intentions. ,</p>

		<h2>The Middle</h2>
		<p>Mister wayne, if you don't want to tell me exactly what you're doing, when i'm asked, i don't have to lie. but don't think of me as an idiot. no, this is mount everest. you should flip on the discovery channel from time to time. but i guess you can't now, being dead and all. the man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks. it only took me six days. same time it took the lord to make the world. you measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you. no, this is mount everest. you should flip on the discovery channel from time to time. but i guess you can't now, being dead and all. it only took me six days. same time it took the lord to make the world. rehabilitated? well, now let me see. you know, i don't have any idea what that means. circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics are the only possessions he will take beyond the grave. i now issue a new commandment: thou shalt do the dance. cities fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. cities fall but they are rebuilt. heroes die but they are remembered. ,</p>

		<h2>The End</h2>
		<p>Bruce... i'm god. the man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks. that tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass. i did the same thing to gandhi, he didn't eat for three weeks. i don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, base-jumping crowd. bruce... i'm god. multiply your anger by about a hundred, kate, that's how much he thinks he loves you. let me tell you something my friend. hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive a man insane. i once heard a wise man say there are no perfect men. only perfect intentions. circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics are the only possessions he will take beyond the grave. i don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, base-jumping crowd. let me tell you something my friend. hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive a man insane. </p>
